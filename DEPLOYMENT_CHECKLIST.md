## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Unsupported post request" Errors**
   - **Cause**: Invalid WhatsApp API credentials
   - **Solution**: Verify all environment variables are set correctly

2. **Download Failures**
   - **Cause**: Missing or invalid cookie files
   - **Solution**: Ensure `ytcookies.txt` and `cookies.txt` are properly formatted with valid cookies

3. **Instagram Private Content Issues**
   - **Cause**: Insufficient Instagram authentication
   - **Solution**: Update `cookies.txt` with fresh session cookies from your browser

4. **Duplicate Sends**

3. ✅ Automatically send the downloaded content back to the user
4. ✅ Handle all platforms correctly without duplicates
5. ✅ Use cookies properly for authenticated downloads

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues after deployment:

1. Check Railway logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure cookie files are properly formatted
4. Test with different content URLs to isolate the issue

The WhatsApp bot is now production-ready and should work exactly as described in your requirements.
