```

### 2. Upload Files

- `config.py` (configuration)
- `ytcookies.txt` (YouTube cookies)
- `cookies.txt` (Instagram cookies)
- `requirements.txt` (dependencies)

### 3. Configure Webhook

Set your Railway app URL as the webhook in your WhatsApp Business API settings:
```

```

### 4. Deploy

Click "Deploy" in Railway to deploy your application.

## Monitoring in Railway Logs

You should see these messages in your Railway deploy logs:

### Successful Download Indicators
```

```

### Error Handling
```
‚ùå Could not fetch media info from YouTube
üîÑ Trying direct download method...
‚úÖ Successfully downloaded using fallback method
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Unsupported post request" Errors**:
   - Cause: Invalid WhatsApp API credentials
   - Solution: Verify all environment variables are set correctly

2. **Download Failures**:
   - Cause: Missing or invalid cookie files
   - Solution: Ensure `ytcookies.txt` and `cookies.txt` are properly formatted

3. **Duplicate Sends**:
   - Cause: Multiple fallback paths being triggered
   - Solution: Already fixed in the code with duplicate detection

4. **Instagram Private Content**:
   - Cause: Insufficient Instagram authentication
   - Solution: Ensure `cookies.txt` contains valid session cookies

### Log Monitoring

Monitor these key log messages:

- `üì• Processing [platform] URL from user` - Request received
- `[download] XX.X% of X.XXMiB` - Download progress
- `‚úÖ Downloaded [X] Instagram media files` - Successful carousel download
- `üì§ Sending...` - About to send media
- `‚úÖ Successfully sent media` - Media sent successfully

## Expected Behavior

After deployment with valid credentials, the bot will:

1. **Download any supported platform content** when a user sends a link
2. **Show download progress** in Railway logs with percentage indicators
3. **Automatically send** the downloaded content back to the user who sent the link
4. **Handle errors gracefully** with user-friendly messages
5. **Prevent duplicate sends** for carousel posts
6. **Use cookies properly** for authenticated downloads

## Support

If you encounter any issues after deployment:

1. Check Railway logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure cookie files are properly formatted
4. Test with different content URLs to isolate the issue

The bot is now production-ready and should work exactly as described in your requirements.
